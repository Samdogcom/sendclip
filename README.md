# sendclip
Send clipboard contents to other devices in lan

I do my jobs on two computers, a ubuntu and a macbookpro. Many times when I need to send clipboard contents from one to another, I found there is no proper tool. So I made this. It may work on windows, but not tested.

## compile
To compile the project only need to install qt5.

## install
I have not made any binary to be downloaded, so, download the code and compile it.
